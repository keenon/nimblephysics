    Same marker set from Tim Dorn's 2012 sprint data. Changed marker locations to best match Rajagopal skeleton since Dorn's data were scaled. In the following: Ham for Hamner 2010, Raja for Rajagopal 2015, 2392 for gait2392 and Dorn for Dorn 2012. Positions for each R/L marker: SH: Ham acromium, C7: Ham C7 (similar to Raja but about 1.5 cm more forward), MAN: Ham clavicle (same as Raja but centered), T7: xy from Dorn, z set to 0 to center (Dorn's C7 Y ~ Raja/Ham C7 Y, thus scales similarly; justifies this approach), ASI: 2392 ASIS (differs from Raja by ~ 1 cm max), SACR: 2392 Sacral (same as Ham), LEPI/MEPI: 2392 Knee Lat/Med (same as Raja), LMAL/MMAL: Raja LMAL/MMAL, HEEL: Raja Cal, P1MT: 2392 Toe Med (similar to Raja TOE but Raja Y higher, 2392 better match Dorn P1MT Y), P5MT: yz of 2392 Toe Lat, x of Dorn (moves back 2 cm), TOE: 2392 Toe Tip (relative to toes), MFS/MFL: 2392 Midfoot Sup/Lat (similar to Ham but 2392 better match Dorn), ELB: Raja LEL, WR: Ham zy of Ham WJC, x of Dorn. Following markers were used for tracking; they were left the same as in Dorn but the y-values were scaled based on the relative y-coords of an antomical marker on the same segment in this model and Dorn's scaled marker positions: Forearm: scale factor = 0.8744 per RWR, Arm: scale factor = 0.9556 per RELB, TILAT/AD/AP: scale factor = 0.8090 (per RLMAL), THLP/LD/AD/AP: scale factor = 0.9057 (per RLEPI).
    
    Based on Dorn's supplementary figures: move MAN down 1 cm (s.t. y = 0.37), move lateral malleolus down ~1 cm (s.t. y = -40), bring TOE posterior 3.12 cm (s.t. x = 0.05)
    
    Markers are right/left symmetrical. Removed fp_ markers. Added virtual markers (see at bottom of file). Explanations are straightforward and given where may be unclear
